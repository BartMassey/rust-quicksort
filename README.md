# Rust Quicksort
Copyright (c) 2018 Bart Massey

This code is partly adapted from an example from the book
*Programming Rust* by Jim Blandy and Jason Orendorff.
It provides a `quicksort` with a custom partitioning
implementation that is also exposed. It is just for fun,
and has not been extensively tested or benchmarked.
